# **Uniflix: AI-Powered Mood-Based Movie Recommendations**  

## Overview 
Uniflix is an innovative movie recommendation app that uses cutting-edge **machine learning (ML)** and the **TMDB API** to tailor movie suggestions based on your facial expressions. By analyzing real-time emotions, Uniflix connects you with movies that match your mood, creating a personalized and intuitive movie discovery experience.  

## Core Features 
### 1. Emotion-Based Movie Recommendations:  
   - Uniflix uses facial recognition to analyze your mood and emotions (happy, sad, surprised, neutral, etc.) to determine your state of mind.  
   - Based on detected emotions, the app queries the **TMDB API** for movies categorized under relevant genres and tones.  

### 2. TMDB Integration:
   - Uniflix leverages the **TMDB (The Movie Database) API** to fetch comprehensive movie data such as genres, ratings, overviews, and trailers.  
   - The app dynamically filters TMDB's movie database using mood insights for precise recommendations.  

### 3. Real-Time ML Analysis:
   - **ML Model**: The facial emotion detection is powered by a machine learning pipeline trained on facial datasets using TensorFlow or PyTorch.  
   - **Emotion Detection**: Recognizes key expressions like joy, anger, sadness, fear, and surprise by analyzing facial landmarks in real-time.  

### 4. User-Friendly Interface:
   - Simple onboarding with options for live camera analysis or pre-uploaded images.  
   - Easy-to-navigate dashboard showing emotion-tagged recommendations.  

### 5. Secure and Private:  
   - Uniflix processes facial data locally, ensuring no images or emotional data are stored on servers.  
   - All interactions with the TMDB API are secure and comply with privacy standards.

## Installation Guide
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/username/uniflix.git  
   cd uniflix  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. Set up your TMDB API key:  
   - Sign up or log in to [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/).  
   - Obtain your API key from the settings.  
   - Add the key to a `.env` file in the project root:  
     ```text  
     TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key  
     ```  

4. Run the application:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  or go live via vs code
   ```

## How It Works

### 1. Facial Emotion Analysis:
- Model Details:  
   - A pre-trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** detects emotions based on facial landmarks.  
   - Model input: Webcam feed or uploaded photo.  
   - Output: Predicted emotion categories with confidence scores.  

### 2. Recommendation System:*
- **Emotion Mapping:**  
   - Emotion classes are mapped to genres or tones. For example:  
     - Happy → Comedy, Adventure  
     - Sad → Drama, Romance  
     - Surprised → Thriller, Mystery  

- TMDB API Query:
   - After emotion detection, the app queries TMDB using parameters like genre, popularity, and release year.  
   - Sample TMDB API request:  
     ```http  
     GET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?api_key=<API_KEY>&with_genres=<GENRES>&sort_by=popularity.desc  
     ```  

## Dependencies  
- Python 3.8+  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch for ML model implementation.  
- OpenCV for image/video analysis.  
- Flask/Django for backend (if deploying as a web app).  
- TMDB API for movie data.

## Future Improvements
1. Enhanced Emotion Detection: Expand emotion categories to include complex states like nostalgia, boredom, or excitement.  
2. Multi-Language Movie Database Integration: Add APIs for regional and international streaming platforms.  
3. Watch Party Mode: Introduce group emotion analysis for collaborative movie recommendations.  
4. Cross-Platform Availability: Launch native apps for iOS and Android with the same ML-powered features.
